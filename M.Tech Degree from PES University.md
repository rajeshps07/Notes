## Curriculum
In this M.Tech in Data Science and Machine Learning program in collaboration with PES University, Data Science and Machine Learning concepts will be covered in four modules in the first year, followed by an M.Tech Thesis and an intensive capstone project in the second.



### Module 1
The first module in this M.Tech in Data Science and Machine Learning program will familiarise you with Python for Data Science, SQL Database, and Statistical Methods for Decision Making


#### Python for Data Science
This module will get you started with the introduction to Python and all the essential topics used for Data Science, such as Numpy, Pandas, etc.
* Python basics

Python is a widely used high-level programming language and has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that highlights readability. This module will help you drive through all the fundamentals of programming in Python, such as syntax and semantics, and at the end, you will execute your first Python program.
* Data structures and handling

Data Structure is a specific method to organise and store data for efficient usage of data. In this module, you will learn all the different data structures in Python and learn about handling.
* Functions

Functions are used for code reusability, and this module will help you understand and implement Functions in Python.
* Numpy

This module will give you a deep understanding of exploring data sets using NumPy. NumPy is one of the most widely-used Python libraries. NumPy is a package for scientific computing like working with arrays.
* Pandas

Pandas is also one of the most widely-used Python libraries. Pandas is used to analyse and manipulate data. This module will give you a deep understanding of exploring data sets using Pandas.


#### Database and SQL
Here, we will cover everything you need to know about SQL programming and database, such as DBMS, Normalization, Joins, etc.
* Database concepts

This module will teach all the database concepts, such as DBMS, Normalization, ER model, Joins, etc.
* Data models and SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a set of statements/instructions where users can access and manipulate data in a database. You will learn all the SQL concepts and data models in this module.
* Sub queries & Joins

As the name implies, a join is an operation that combines or joins data or rows from other tables based on the common fields amongst them. In this module, you will go through the types of joins and learn how to combine data. Also, you will learn how to work with subqueries/commands that involve joins.
* Analytical / Window Functions

A function that determines values in a group of rows and generates a single result for every row is known as an Analytic/Window Function.
* Transaction Processing - ACID properties

In this module, you will learn everything you need to know about ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties of Transaction Processing.


#### Statistical Methods for Decision Making
In the next module, you will learn everything you need to know about all the statistical methods used for decision making in this M.Tech in Data Science course.
* Descriptive statistics

The study of data analysis by describing and summarising several data sets is known as Descriptive Analysis. It can either be a sample of a region’s population or the marks achieved by 50 students. This module will help you understand the Descriptive Statistics concepts.
* Probability & Distributions

A statistical function reporting all the probable values that a random variable takes within a specific range is known as a Probability Distribution. This module will teach you about Probability Distributions and various types like Binomial, Poisson, and Normal Distribution in Python.
* Hypothesis testing

This module will teach you about Hypothesis Testing in Statistics. Hypothesis Testing is a necessary procedure in Applied Statistics for doing experiments based on the observed/surveyed data.
* ANOVA, ChiSquare

Analysis of Variance, also known as ANOVA, is a statistical technique used in Data Science, which is used to split observed variance data into various components for additional analysis and tests. Chi-Square is a Hypothesis testing method used in Statistics, which is used to measure how a model compares to actual observed data. This module will teach you how to identify the significant differences between the means of two or more groups.
* Statistical Simulation Techniques

This module will teach you how to work with several Statistical Simulation Techniques.



### Module 2
The second module in this M.Tech in Data Science and Machine Learning program will start with an introduction to Machine Learning Regression algorithms, and then building up with essential mathematical concepts, and Data Visualization.


#### Machine Learning: Regression Algorithms
In this M.Tech in Machine Learning course, you will learn everything about regression algorithms.
* Exploratory data analysis

This module will teach you all about Exploratory Data Analysis using Python for Machine Learning.
* Feature engineering

Feature engineering is transforming data from the raw state to a state where it becomes suitable for modelling. It converts the data columns into features that are better at representing a given situation in terms of clarity. The quality of the component in distinctly representing an entity impacts the model’s quality in predicting its behaviour. In this module, you will learn several steps involved in Feature Engineering.
* Linear Regression - Model building & Fine tuning

Linear Regression is one of the most popular ML algorithms used for predictive analysis in Machine Learning, resulting in producing the best outcomes. It is a technique assuming a linear relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable. This module will take you through all the Linear Regression concepts and teach you which model best suits architecture by evaluating every individual model based on the requirements using Model building & Fine-tuning.
* Regularization Techniques

Regularization is a technique to modify machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of machine learning models. This module will teach all regularization techniques used in machine learning.
* Model deployment

This module will teach you how to deploy your machine learning models using Docker, Kubernetes, etc.


#### Mathematical Foundation
The next module will teach you all the fundamentals of Mathematical Foundations like Linear Algebra, Matrices, etc.
* Linear Algebra for Data Science

This module will drive you through all the essential concepts like Linear Algebra to implement Mathematics for Data Science.
* Matrices and Image processing

Image Processing is the process of extraction, filtering, enhancement etc., of images with the help of mathematical operations like matrices. This module will teach you how to perform mathematical operations on matrices to enhance the specific image.
* Functions and Derivatives

This module will teach you how to use all the functions and derivatives for your ML algorithms.
* Optimisation and Loss functions

Loss Function is a technique for prediction error of neural networks. The optimisation technique tries to minimise a loss function.

#### Data Visualization
The last topic in Module 2 of the M.Tech in Machine Learning course is Data Visualization. The process of the graphical representation of data and information is known as Data Visualization. This module will teach you how to use data visualization tools for providing data trends and patterns.
* Structuring Analytic problems

This module will teach you how to structure and solve analytic problems using Data Visualization techniques.
* Analytical framework

The data analytical framework is a process of collecting customers’ problems to solve them subsequently. This module will teach you how to solve these issues.
* Data Storytelling

Data Storytelling is the process of reading data in-depth, identifying critical messages, and communicating these messages in the most effective ways.
* Dashboard and Visualisation principles

In this module, you will learn how to create an interactive dashboard and charts to organise data using Visualisation principles.
* Tableau

Tableau is the most widely used data visualization tool to solve problems. This module will teach you everything you need to know about Tableau.
* PowerBI

PowerBI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft, which is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors working together so that it can turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.
